## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, a convolutional neural network is used to classify traffic signs. A model is trained and validated so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, the model is tested on images of traffic signs found on the web.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

Code guidelines
---

You can find the file Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb that is a Jupyter notebook with Python code and report altogether.

The German traffic sign images used for the project can be found in the original Udacity repository (the pickled data files train.p, valid.p and test.p) and have to be copied into the project folder where the notebook is located.
